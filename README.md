# CS420-Project1
Web Development Project One. HTML / CSS / JS

This Repo / Project is explicitly for the CS-420 Web Development class at the University of Missouri - Kansas City

The project has guidelines which have been distributed to its contributors. We don't have a lot of wiggle room in deviating from the specifications.

A few standards:
* CamelCaseClassAndFunctionNames
* function() { Anonymous } is okay, but try to keep functions seperate for easier debugging.
* CSS elements should be classes if they are duplicated and referenced by ID if they are not.

If you have any questions, please feel free to email me at jrkn87@mail.umkc.edu
